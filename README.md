# Welcome To My Third Project

This is another documentation of my progress using html and css. I have made this page mobile responsive,
and added clickeable links. Some of the struggles that I have faced included, understanding how to use the inspector
developer tools, and understanding how css behaves in the browser. I have walked away with a deeper understanding 
of css and the abiliy to confidently solve various front-end browser issues.As well as the ability to troubleshoot header and footer 
and object placement within the browser.
